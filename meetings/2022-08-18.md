## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Best Practices Document [#819](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/819)
  * Discussions around adding malicious code as an example, to improve the user understanding.
  * @naugtur raised a concern in a previous meeting. Rafael reached to him to elaborate.
  * Currently, the WG is tempted to accept adding malicious code as a way to explain attacks and how they can be prevented.
  * In case someone has a strong opinion on this, please share it in the issue.

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  * Rafael suggested to filter the output to show only the reported CVE.
    * It will avoid mistakes such as https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues/51
  * Rafael suggested including a map between dependency and teams to ping when a CVE is found. It should provide more visibility.

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  * Discussions in the document
  * A separate meeting will be scheduled to cover it deeply

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * We are on agreement on the name `Permissions` using `--deny-fs` as a flag.
  * We need agreement on the way it overlaps with the `policy` system.
    * @GeoffreyBooth suggested renaming the current `policy` docs to `Permissions` and then mentioning both methods.
    * Michael concurs with this change and raised the importance to say how both features can be used together.
  * Rafael is working to handle `child_process` cases
      * Propagation is an option
      * `--allow-spawn` will still be needed to handle `exec()` cases
  * Rafael have a different PR to make ReqWrap weak, so weâ€™ll be able to throw exceptions after the object creation
    * https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44074

* What security guidance would be most useful for Node.js developers? [#488](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/488)
  * It was removed from the agenda. The Best Practices document will supersede it.

* feature request for `require.pure(id)` or `pkg.pure:true` [#467](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/467)
  * Skipped
