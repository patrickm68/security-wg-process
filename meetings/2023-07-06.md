### nodejs/security-wg

* Audit build process for dependencies [#1037](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1037)
  * The final objective is to make nodejs build immutable
  * Some of our dependencies are mutable, so this affects our builds
  * We might want to keep our dependencies in a artifact repository to have more control over the dependencies and as well to reduce the build time for Node.js itself
  * Next steps: There is a checklist that can be split between the team to start the review

* Initiative for CII-Best-Practices for Node.js Projects [#953](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/953)
  * Missing ~6 things for the Silver level (waiting for final clarification)
    * We have an agreement on 3 of them
  * Jordan will helps us to clarify questions and he will provide support to us on this matter
* Permission Model - Roadmap [#898](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/898)
  * Skipped due time
* Automate security release process [#860](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/860)
  * Skipped due time
* Assessment against best practices (OpenSSF Scorecards ...) [#859](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/859)
