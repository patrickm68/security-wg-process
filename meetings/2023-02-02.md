## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

- [x] Vulnerability Review - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues
- Potential malware packet (named as v8 in Npm) (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrvq-xhqr-7ppq), seems like it was removed and not a thread at the moment.
Seems like a typosquatting attack for the community users.
