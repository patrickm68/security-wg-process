## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* OpenJS Foundation Slack channel [#812](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/812)
  * already covered, slack channel is `#nodejs-security-wg`

* Open discussion about VM module [#811](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/811)
  * The current statement in the Threat Model is not clear:
  > The `vm` module aims to run code in a different V8 context, therefore, it’s not a security mechanism
  * Instead of expose threats directly in the docs, we'll rephrase that statement to:
  > The `vm` module was not created to hold a secure context. It doesn't provide enough isolation from popular threats.
  > Therefore is not a security mechanism. Don’t run untrusted code on it (see).

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  * Making good progress
  * Facundo has landed script to do check
  * Michael has added repo/action here to run regularly on main. Need backports before we can
    do the same for LTS versions. - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments
  * Discussions around the best way to create the reports
    * What do we do from the vulnerabilities we get after querying when:
      1) The vulnerabilities don't specify a version range that's affected
      2) The vulnerability is uploaded before the full information is available
    * Facundo will raise an issue/comment to discuss it further
  * Discussions around the vulnerability ignorelist

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  * Potential Mitigation and Mitigations are different?
    * Facundo: All the mitigations are eventually potential mitigation. It makes the problem less severe or less likely
    * Removing the "Explore Potential Mitigation" and explicitly highlight the fact some mitigations are experimental
  * In the main document we don't need to mitigation explanation for each threat. It should be concise and shorter.
  * Discuss high level what is/is not considered a vulnerability?
    * Michael create a concise section to be included on the top of the document
    * This section includes two list:
      1) What Node.js trusts/make assumptions
      2) What Node.js does NOT trust
    * This document will include
      * What can be considered a vulnerability in Node.js
      * What even having a threat addressed is not considered a vulnerability for Node.js. The users will need to protect against it by themselves.
  * We don't need to specify the Environment section in the Threat Document
    * This document exposes what Node.js do/do not protect regardless of the user environment

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
* What security guidance would be most useful for Node.js developers? [#488](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/488)
