# Review of last meeting


# New agenda

## Hacker one setup/demo

* @vdeturckheim gave us a walkthrough of what he has setup.
* Easy to invite people to collaborate on specific vulnerabilities
*

##  Bug Bounty Program https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/49

* want to add bounties Node.js to list they provide bounties for.
* not a huge amount of money ($1500 at the top end)
* does provide some additional motivation for researchers to find/report
  Issues.
* There is no cost to the project (Internet bug bounty would provide for free)
* Only for security vulnerabilities, do they need to go through hacker one.
* Needs to meet some minimum bar.
* Michael: should probably get hacker one setup done first ?
* Michael Alexander volunteered to champion this on the Security-wg, like with an
  end of year timeframe.

## Proposing an Early Disclosure Program  https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/58

* One thing discussed was to get more input from the potential consumers
* Vladimir will put together and issue, twitter etc to try to gather that input.

## acknowledge privacy of info in private repos.https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/64

* general consensus that having document and having people acknowledge in issue 64 is good
  enough

* Discuss issue linked with potential confusion between 2 HackerOne orgs from security reporters
* @vdeturckheim to create email alias for 3rd party vulnerability report
