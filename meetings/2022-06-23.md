## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  - Facundo Tuesca created the PR: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43362 on Public repo
  - Needs review from Security WG

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  - Rafael: I've added two sections in the end to summarize the work.
  The Agenda section aims to have all the questions for discussion in the Next Security WG.
  The Threat List contains all the threads that need to be addressed in this document but weren't addressed yet.

  - Q: How to address STRIDE in this document?
    - Rafael: Currently, we are following STRIDE (not explicitly) to build this document
    - Mike: The idea review this document with STRIDE on mind. There is nothing specifically to add.
    - Mike suggests to rename "What does Node.js trust/not trust" to "Security Assurance and Garanties"

  - Q: Are potential mitigations and mitigations different?
    - Consensus to keep you on the list until Michael and Bradley are able to join

  - Q: Denied of Service using Events is a valid threat to this document?
    - That's expected. This is not a vulnerability, but remains as an threat
    - Would be great to add to the second document (tutorial), how Node.js developers can avoid it.
    - The statement should be more generic as there is several ways to "crash" a Node.js application

  - Q: Can Security-Introduction be recycled in this document?
    - It better suits to the future second document (tutorial)

  - Q: How can we make the `vm` statement clear?
    - Rafael will try to rephrase it
    - Reference: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40718
    - Ulises suggests a different approach to the `vm` statement. The idea is to say that
      `vm` was designed to X and not Y

  - Discussions around the term: "scale permissions in runtime"
    - Rafael will try to rephrase it

  - Best Practices section can be moved to the second document
    - Removed from the Threat Model

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  - Rafael is working in new granular approach
