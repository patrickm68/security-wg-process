- [X] Vulnerability Review - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues

### nodejs/security-wg

* Node.js Security WG Initiatives 2023 [#846](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/846)
  * Ulises will update the Security WG README to include the next initiatives
  * Currently, we have two well defined initiatives
    * Permission Model
    * Automate update dependencies
  * There’s a consensus the checker when vulnerable is a good thing. However, we don’t know exactly in which place it would be better. Rafael will open an issue to discuss it with the TSC. We currently have two options: 1) work together with npm team to include this check when `npm install` 2) behind a flag --abort-when-vulnerable

* Automate updates of all dependencies [#828](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/828)
  * OpenSSL automation was created https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45605
    * Discussion to keep 2 commits for OpenSSL update
    * Currently, the action only accepts one commit, so if we really need two commits for OpenSSL update, we would need to rewrite a few things
    * Rafael: I think we can try with one commit
  * Base64, Acorn and Libuv update tools already merged

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * Very good progress
  * non-permissive approach merged
  * Fixed a bug on the RadixTree algorithm
  * Next steps: Documentation/Symlink edge cases


### nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments

* Recursive support on Node.js dependencies [#89](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues/89)
  * The npm dependency contains a node_modules without a package-lock, so when npm audit runs, it will download the latest dependency, therefore, showing a false-negative.
  * Thomas suggested using arborist manually
