## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg


* Security Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  * Agreement to rename the document to Threat Model
  * Other language references
    * [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/SECURITY.md#security-model)
    * [Ruby](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)
  * Michael suggests defining “What Node.js trust and what Node.js don’t trust” before the threat per environment section
    * As a complement Facundo suggests to define places that might or might not be potential attack vectors. e.g: CLI
  * Node.js trust the code and even having potential mitigations (policy, frozen-intrinsics), they don’t allow an end-user to run untrusted code without an unexpected behavior.
  * Potential mitigation as `policy` doesn't allow running untrusted code
  * Zb: Policy can be a mitigation for supply chain attack
  * Zb: There is a “compartments” proposal in TC39 that might help in security mitgations https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments. This is similar to vm module.
  * Bradley: “compartments” is not going to have the same functionality as the vm module. Prototype pollution and other attack vectors will still be possible.
  * Bradley: In a Security Model we should target security intents in the platform, which means, saying the Node.js has the intent to provide a security mechanism or at least explain what action a user should take by reading this document
  * Michael: suggest to create a best practices section by environment 
  * Node.js trusts in the user to configure a safe filesystem to the current Module Resolution Algorithm works safer
  * Bradley suggests creating a Mitigation section that will serve as a reference for each environment mitigation
  * STRIDE might be useful to people reading the docs to have an understanding of what we are doing
  * Possible ToC
    * What does Node.js trust/not trust
    * Threats, applicability, categorized by STRIDE
    * Environments - Discussion of Threats, best practice for mitigations outside of Node.js through references to Threat mitigations section.
    * Threat mitigations
    * Security model asset references (choose one, ref and use through doc)

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * Rafael: No changes so far (busy week)


* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * Facundo gave an overview of this work
  * Rafael: What action would it take when a vuln is found?
  * Facundo: An issue would be created
  * Zb: Implementing the ignore filter can be tricky. Rather, create an issue at every run seems reasonable
