## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  * PR Ready
  * Next steps:
    * Integrate to CI (GH Actions) (once per day)
    * Create issue in the repo (with security-wg-agenda label)

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  * Q1: Potential Mitigations vs Mitigations question – Skipped
  * Q2: When should we publish this document?
    * We need to define a goal for this document to send it to live
    * The priority is to address the most common threats, we can set a goal of an arbitrary number of common threats
  * Q3: List threats to be addressed in that document
    * _Discussions around the Threat List from the document_
    * Facundo is working in the HTTP Request Smuggling Threat
    * Ulises is working in the Prototype Polution Threat
    * Suggestion to add to the _"What nodejs trust/do not trust"_ section
      * Node.js does not trust user input. Safe functions are used in the entire platform. In case somebody finds a way to exploit it, is certainly a vulnerability
    * Discussions around Unsanitized inputs
  * Q4: `vm` module as a security mechanism discussion
    * This is not considered a security mechanism, but it's not clear the reason
    * We need to address it in someway. Created [issue #811](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/811)
  * HTTP Parser content seems incorrect.
    * One section says: When the server receives a request it parses that request into a header and a body
    * In another specific section it says it does not parse the content of the header or the body, which sounds incorrect since it needs to parse the Content-Length of the request to split the header/body
    * Reference: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver:~:text=It%20parses%20a%20message
  * Discussions around: "Nodejs trust in the filesystem"
    * It needs to be clarified

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * Rafael didn’t have enough time to work on that. He’s working adding granularity to the MVP.
