## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  * Michael adjusted the CI to run 18.x branch
  * A PR was created and merged to avoid duplicated issues (https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/pull/42)
    * It's working fine so far
  * A new PR was open in the main repo to search for vulnerabilities using CPE on `undici` project

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
  * Discussions around what Node.js trust/do not trust
    * Andrew suggested to reduce the scope of some statements to make it clear
  * Michael took an action to clarify some statements by specifying what Node.js doesn't trust
  * See all the discussions in the document

* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
  * Draft PR Created (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44004)
  * Rafael currently is working on the radix-tree implementation for path matching
  * Discussion around the feature name (policy)
    * The current `policy` is _ experimental _, meaning that if the permission system uses its scope, it will create an unnecessary dependency.
    * The permission system mechanism might never go `stable` if the current `policy` mechanism doesn't go `stable`
    * We're reevaluating a new name:
      - Access Control (`--access-deny-fs=`)
      - Permission System (`--permission-deny-fs=`)

* What security guidance would be most useful for Node.js developers? [#488](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/488)
  * It will be superseded by the Best Practices Document [#819](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/819)

* feature request for `require.pure(id)` or `pkg.pure:true` [#467](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/467)
  * Skipped

* Best Practices Document [#819](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/819)
  * Ulises created the Best Practices document
  * A large part of the Threat Model document has been moved into this document
  * The next steps can be:
    * Points to the Threat Model as reference
    * Include some examples of threats that aren't considered a vulnerability, and more importantly, how users can mitigate them.
    * Sort the Threat List by CWE (or name)
