## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Best Practices Document [#819](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/819)
  * Removed the Assumptions tab
  * Next steps:
    * Rename the threat list to a user-friendly title
    * Split specific mitigations into a separate blog post/document
    * e.g Instead of pointing `policy` as a mitigation, would be great to have `Using Policies to mitigate X`.
  * Once the above steps are concluded, we can open a pull request.

* Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/802)
  * Maintaining blacklist in the Node.js repository is hard.
    * Backport it to active release lines is worse
  * Facundo suggested to move the blacklist to the nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments repository
    * Rafael said that blacklist might be completely superseded by GH Issues
    * Discussions around potential fixes
  * Rafael suggested creating a root issue and making it available in the security-wg agenda, to not lose the track of those vulnerabilities
    * Even if an vulnerability doesn't affect Node.js, it might affect in the future.
      * e.g: Vulnerability in InflateX is tagged as `does-not-affect-nodejs`, a week later someone uses that function

* Threat Model [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)
* Permission Model [#791](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791)
* feature request for `require.pure(id)` or `pkg.pure:true` [#467](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/467)
