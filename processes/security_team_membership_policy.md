# Node.js Security Team Membership Policy

The Node.js Security Team (@nodejs/security) has
access to security-sensitive issues and patches that aren't appropriate for
public availability.

> Note: Due to implementation details and a bit of human error, the list of
> people with access to the security patches isn't 100% in line with the
> @nodejs/security membership. See the [membership list](./security_team_members.md)
> for details. This situation is intended to be corrected in the near future.

This is different than the security triage team, which is defined by the
[`security@nodejs.org` email alias](https://github.com/nodejs/email/blob/master/iojs.org/aliases.json).
Inclusion in that group is on a volunteer basis, upon approval by the Technical
Steering Committee (TSC).

The policy for inclusion on the @nodejs/security is as follows:

1. All members of @nodejs/TSC are members of @nodejs/security.
2. On a case-by-case basis, individuals outside the Technical Steering Committee
   are invited by the TSC to join @nodejs/security so that their expertise can
   be applied to an issue or patch. Once their assistance is no longer required
   for a particular issue or patch, they are removed from the team.
3. Members of the [release team](https://github.com/nodejs/node#release-team)
   are also members of @nodejs/security, as they need access to the patches in
   order to produce releases.
4. Members of the security triage team are members of @nodejs/security.
